 == NAC Masked Pixels ==
This file contains the values of the masked columns to be used in the NAC calibration.
It is separated into odd and even column numbers. These values are used to create an even and odd
average masked pixel DN value for each line that is subtracted from that line.

  Latest files created by Jacob Danton on July 06, 2010 with values confirmed by Dave Humm. 
  These values corresponded with the new masked pixel subtraction algorithm:
    NACL_MaskedPixels.0002.pvl
    NACR_MaskedPixels.0002.pvl

 == NAC Average Darks ==
This file contains the average dark image after masked pixels are subtracted.
The image is subtracted from each line after the masked pixels.

  Latest files created by Dave Humm on June 02, 2010. These files corresponded with the new
  masked pixel subtraction algorithm: 
    NACL_AverageDarks.0006.cub
    NACL_AverageDarks_Summed.0006.cub
    NACR_AverageDarks.0006.cub
    NACR_AverageDarks_Summed.0006.cub

 == NAC Flatfields ==
This file contains the flatfield image. It is used as a divisor for each line.

  Latest files created by Jacob Danton on June 20, 2010. They were generated using the most recent
  yaw images (DOY 126) and a modified version of Eric Eliason's script. These values corresponded with
  the new masked pixel subtraction algorithm:
    NACL_Flatfield.0006.cub
    NACL_Flatfield_Summed.0006.cub
    NACR_Flatfield.0006.cub
    NACR_Flatfield_Summed.0006.cub

 == NAC Linearization ==
These files contain the offsets and coefficients for the linearization of the
NAC images. The *Coefficients file contains 3 values for each pixel in the
line and the *Offsets contain a single offset value for each pixel. 

  Latest files created by Dave Humm on June 02, 2010. These values corresponded with the new masked pixel
  subtraction algorithm:
    NACL_LinearizationCoefficients.0006.txt
    NACL_LinearizationOffsets.0006.cub
    NACL_LinearizationOffsets_Summed.0006.cub
    NACR_LinearizationCoefficients.0006.txt
    NACR_LinearizationOffsets.0006.cub
    NACR_LinearizationOffsets_Summed.0006.cub

 == NAC Radiometric ==
This file contains the Radiometry coefficients for both I over F and Radiance
absolute calibration.

  Latest files created by Jacob Danton on Jan 21, 2010 with values confirmed by
Dave Humm:
    NAC_RadiometricResponsivity.0003.pvl
   
 
 == WAC Average Darks ==
This file contains the average dark on a per WAC frame basis. It is subtracted
from each frame in an image.

  Latest files created by Eric Eliason on Feb 4, 2010:
    wac_darks/WAC_[Instrument Mode]_Offset[CCD Offset]_[Temperature]C_[Time]T.0005.cub
    
 == WAC Flatfields ==
This file contains the flatfield per WAC frame and is used as a divisor for
each frame in an image.

  Latest files created by Brett Denevi on Feb 5, 2010:
    wac_flats/WAC_[Instrument Mode]_Flatfield.0003.cub

 == WAC Radiometric ==
This file contains the radiometric coefficients for both I over F and Radiance
absolute calibration.

  Latest files created by Jacob Danton on July 7, 2011 with values confirmed
by Sarah Braden:
    WAC_RadiometricResponsivity.0004.pvl

 == WAC Special Pixels ==
This file contains a frame mask for special pixels. It is applied to each
frame in an image.
