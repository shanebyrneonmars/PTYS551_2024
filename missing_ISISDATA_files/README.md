For reasons that are not understood ```downloadIsisData``` can sometimes fail to grab some small text files in the ```$ISISDATA``` area. Specifically, there are a handful of files in the ```$ISISDATA/lro/calibration``` and ```$ISISDATA/mro/calibration``` areas that sometimes need to be manually added. 

The two subdirectories contain those files. If you get some errors about missing files in the LRO or MRO calibration areas then please drop them into ```$ISISDATA/lro/calibration``` or ```$ISISDATA/mro/calibration```.

Thanks To Euibin Kim for collecting these files up!
