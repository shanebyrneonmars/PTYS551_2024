Each line matches the latitude, longitude, radius, and altitude values from a record in an MLA Geolocated Science Version 2 product.
The MLA Geolocated Science Version 2 products provide absolute radial distance from the center of mass of Mercury, which 
uses a Mercury reference radius of 2439.4 km. The altitude is calculated by subtracting the Mercury 
reference radius from the product record radius value.
